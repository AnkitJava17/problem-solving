Write an algo for checking a num to be perfect.

1. Start
2. take input num
3. if num less than equal to zero print false and go to 10
4. declare sum = 1
5. declare i=2
6. if i is smaller than (nearest whole number of half of n) + 1 
	goto 7 else goto 8
7. if num is divisible by i add it to sum and increament i to i + 1
8. go to step 6
9. if sum less than num	print false and go to 11
10. if sum equals num print True and go to 11
11. end
